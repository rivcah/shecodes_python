##given two numbers a, b, return their sum. 
##Unless they are equal. In this case, 
##return the double of their sum.
##Using condiotions

def numsum(a, b): ##this function takes two arguments a,b 
  nums = (a+b)
  double = 2*(nums)
  if a==b: ##if variable a is equal to variable b
    return(double) ##the return is the double of the sum
   else: ##if variables a and b are different
    return(nums) ##the function returns the sum of a and b
